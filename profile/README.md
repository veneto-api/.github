Veneto: Modern tooling for hypermedia APIs
======

Veneto is an API design ecosystem consisting of:

 - **The Veneto Language:** An ergonomic and expressive domain modeling language to define data formats and API flows, which powers:
 - **The Veneto Test Client:** A practical, user-friendly test client that adapts to the specifics of the user's domain model. This will first be implemented as a VSCode extension.
 - **The Veneto Toolkit:** Code generation and maintenance tools to help developers create and use APIs without being encumbered by boilerplate 
 
There's much more to come on this page, but for the best glance at what this project is about, check out the [announcement post](https://www.jakeconley.com/posts/2023-02-07_veneto-announcement.htm). 

This project is organized on [Notion](https://veneto.notion.site), which contains our public roadmap as well as all up-to-date documentation about the state of the project.

Current Status
----

We just finished building out the parser for the Veneto Language, and we're now moving on to implementing the Language Server and the Test Client.
